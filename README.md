 Netflix Movies Analysis

    With over 247 million paying customers in over 190 countries, Netflix is one of the most popular entertainment providers in the world. Users can enjoy TV shows, movies, and games in a range of genres and languages.

    The dataset in this case includes information from 2014 through 2021. Important columns are RunTime, Titles, IMDB Score, Genre, Language, and Release Date.  Using this information, we analyze the data to find the components that could improve Netflix's streaming experience and draw in more users from around the world.

    The majority of the data visualizations in the analysis were made utilizing Python programs that used the Seaborn and Matplotlib packages. A PowerPoint presentation with the solution has been made at the end of the analysis.
